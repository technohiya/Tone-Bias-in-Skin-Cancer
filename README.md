# Tone-Bias-in-Skin-Cancer
Identifying Tone Bias in Skin Cancer using CNN

This project investigates whether convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for skin cancer detection exhibit performance bias across different skin tones. Using dermoscopic images and fairness-aware evaluation, the study compares how models behave on lighter vs darker skin tone groups and examines how dataset imbalance contributes to bias.

This project explores:
> Do CNN-based skin cancer classifiers show tone-based bias?
> How does dataset imbalance affect fairness?
> Can balancing the dataset reduce disparities?
> Do different CNN architectures behave differently in terms of fairness?
